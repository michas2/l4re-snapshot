This file shall briefly describe the ways how to handle the snapshot.

We would really like that you read all of the README before asking
questions, although this file might be longer than you (and we) want.
Thanks a lot in advance.



Host system requirements
========================

 The host system must a be an x86 32bit or 64bit based system with a recent
 Linux distribution installed and at least 2GB of free disk space.

 All necessary tools required by the build are available from the provided
 packages of the Linux distributions (except the cross compiler needed for
 ARM compiles). You might want to run 'make check_build_tools' in the src/l4
 directory to verify the common tools are installed.

 You are free to use any Linux distribution you like, or even BSDs or any of
 its derivatives. But then you should know the game. Especially tool
 versions should be recent, as installed on the listed distributions below.

 We are confident that the snapshot works on the following distributions:
   - Debian 8 or later
   - Ubuntu 14.10 or later



Cross compiling for ARM
=======================

 For compiling software for the ARM target on an x86 host a cross compiler
 is needed.

 Two popular prebuilt cross compilers exist. You can also check
 http://elinux.org/ARMCompilers for more info:

 - Linaro cross-compilers:
     https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/+download
   Note that the Linaro cross compilers build for hard floating point, so
   builds with those compilers will only work on appropriate targets.
   This compiler will not work for ARMv5/ARM9 targets.

 - Codesourcery / Mentor cross-compilers:
   See http://elinux.org/ARMCompilers to get an arm-2014.05 version.
   Alternatively go via the https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/.

 Alternatively:
   You have your own gcc cross compiler with at least version 4.7 installed
   that is known to be working.


 Before compiling, make sure the compiler and its tools are available in
 your PATH with the prefix arm-linux-, .e.g. arm-linux-gcc.
 To ease this the bin directory in the snapshot contains a small script that
 will call the compiler tools appropriately.  Either put the bin directory
 in your PATH environment variable or make this script available in your
 local bin directory (an example is displayed after 'make setup').
 The script will use the environment variable GCC_PATH_PREFIX to find the
 compiler you installed. An example could be:
   export GCC_PATH_PREFIX=/opt/arm-2014.05/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi- 

 The build script will take care of using the bin directory of the
 snapshot but for convenient usage during development it is advised to have
 the tool generally available.

Building
========

 In the upper most directory of the archive (the same directory where this
 README is located) contains a Makefile. To setup the snapshot issue
   make setup
 and to build it issue
   make
 in the snapshot directory. Add -j X as wanted.

Directory layout
================

   - bin
      arm-linux-*: Some scripts, one for calling compiler tools
                   appropriately.
   - doc
      source
        Contains documentation automatically generated from the documented
        source code. Overview documentation is also included there.
        l4re-source.pdf: PDF file of the generated code
        html: HTML version of the documentation. Can be viewed in any recent
              web browser.
   - obj
      Generated object code will be placed under the obj directory.
      fiasco
        Fiasco build directories, e.g.:
	  amd64:       configuration for x86-64
          arm-mpcore:  configuration built for the ARM11MPCore board
          arm-up:      configuration built for QEMU (realview, single core)
          ia32:        configuration for x86-32
          ux:          configuration for Fiasco-UX (x86-32 host)
      l4
        L4Re build drectories, e.g:
          amd64:       L4Re built for x86-64
          arm-rv-arm9: L4Re built for ARM Realview target (compiled for ARMv5)
          arm-rv-ca::  L4Re built for ARM Versatile Express target (compiled for Cortex-A)
          x86:         L4Re built for x86-32

      l4linux
        L4Linux build directories, e.g.:
	  amd64:       L4Linux build for x86-64
	  ux:          L4Linux build for x86-32 (without drivers)

   - src
      Contains the source code:
      kernel/fiasco: Fiasco source
      l4:            L4Re source
      l4linux:       L4Linux
      tools:         Tools needed for compilation

   - files
      Miscellaneous files.
      ramdisk-x86.rd:    Ramdisks for (L4)Linux.
      ramdisk-arm.rd:    Ramdisks for (L4)Linux.
      ramdisk-amd64.rd:  Ramdisks for (L4)Linux.

 All object directories are built by default.

Serial Console
==============

 If you happen to use Windows as your workstation OS to conncet to your
 target machine we recommend using PuTTY (free, open source tool, ask your
 favorite search engine) as a terminal emulator. Hyperterm is not
 recommended because it is basically unable to display all the output
 properly.
 On Linux hosts the situation is much more relaxed, minicom and PuTTY are
 known to work, as probably any other solution.

QEMU
====

 To run the built system under QEMU, go to an appropriate l4/
 obj-directory of your choice, such as obj/l4/x86, and run:
   make qemu
 This will display a dialog menu to let you choose an entry to boot. For
 example, choose 'hello' and you should see the system starting and finally
 see "Hello World" scroll by periodically.

Configuring Images and Search Paths
===================================

 The configuration file to configure the contents of images and generally
 the entries to boot is
   src/l4/conf/modules.list
 containing entries sections with modules for each entries listed.
 The search paths required to find the binaries and files are configured
 through Makeconf.boot file(s). Locations in the the src-directory as well
 as in the obj-directories are checked. The locations are
 src/l4/conf/Makeconf.boot and obj-dir/conf/Makeconf.boot.
 The paths can be configured globally or per make target. Please refer to
 src/l4/conf/Makeconf.boot.example for usage examples.

Generating Images
=================

 To generate an image, for example to load on a target system, 
 go the build directory and issue:
   make elfimage E=hello
 to build the standard hello target as an ELF image.
 You may specify any other entry with E=xxx from the modules.list file, or
 leave it out to get a dialog displayed for interactive selection.
 Type 'make help' in the l4/ directory or the build directory to see all
 possible targets.

Adding your own code
====================

 Your own code should be placed outside the snapshot directory. This allows
 that the snapshot can be replaced with a more recent version without
 needing to take care about your own files and directories.

 Software components are usually put into so-called packages, and each
 package has a structure like this:
    pkgname/
            doc/               - Documentation for the package
            include/           - Public headers for the package
            lib/               - Library code
              src/
            server/            - Program code
              src/

 This is just a recommended structure, it is not required to be like that.
 What is built is defined in the Makefiles in each directory.

 A typical Makefile looks like this:

 PKGDIR  ?= .
 L4DIR   ?= path/to/your/l4dir

 # Statements specific to the used role

 include $(L4DIR)/mk/<role>.mk

 Role might be:
   - subdir:  Descent to further subdirectories
   - lib:     Build a library
   - prog:    Build a program
   - include: Process include files

 The directory l4/mk/tmpl contains a template package directory layout
 structure and shows how a package might look like. It also contains
 examples on what to do in the Makefiles.

 A very basic example might go like this:

 $ mkdir /tmp/myfirstpkg
 $ cd /tmp/myfirstpkg
 $ editor Makefile
 $ cat Makefile
 PKGDIR  ?= .
 L4DIR   ?= /path/to/snapshot/src/l4

 TARGET          = myfirstprogram
 SRC_C           = main.c

 include $(L4DIR)/mk/prog.mk
 $ editor main.c
 $ cat main.c
 #include <stdio.h>

 int main(void)
 {
   printf("Hello!\n");
   return 0;
 }
 $ make O=/path/to/snapshot/obj/l4/arm-rv-arm9
 ...
 $ ls /path/to/snapshot/obj/l4/arm-rv-arm9/bin/arm_rv/l4f/myfirstprogram
 /path/to/snapshot/obj/l4/arm-rv-arm9/bin/arm_rv/l4f/myfirstprogram
 $


Tips and tricks
===============

 If you're just building for one build directory you can do the
 following to avoid the O=... argument on every make call.

 Put O=/path/to/the/build-dir into L4DIR/Makeconf.local

 Also, you can just issue 'make' in the build directories directly.


Setup for multiple packages
===========================

 Create a directory structure like this:

  dir/
  dir/pkg1
  dir/pkg2
  dir/pkg3

 Put this Makefile into dir/Makefile:

  PKGDIR  = .
  L4DIR   ?= /path/to/your/l4dir/l4

  TARGET = $(wildcard [a-zA-Z]*)

  include $(L4DIR)/mk/subdir.mk

 This will build all sub packages from within this directory. Make sure
 to define L4DIR properly in every Makefile in the packages (or
 alternatively, include a file which defines it, but this file has to be
 absolute as well). 
 In the package directories you can have the normal Makefiles as in
 l4/pkg/pkgname.
